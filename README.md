**4. Insights & Findings:** Extracting valuable business intelligence from sales data.

# Key Skills Practiced:
* Data cleaning and structuring
* SQL queries (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Business Insights & Findings

# Questions Addressed:
The project includes a series of **10 SQL questions**, designed to simulate real-world data analysis tasks.
### SQL Questions:
1. Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05'.
2. Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022.
